parameter,type,cpp_type,value,frequently_used,description
ad_weight,float,OT_DOUBLE,,,"Weighting factor for derivative calculation.When there is an option of either using forward or reverse mode directional derivatives, the condition ad_wei ght*nf<=(1- ad_weight)*na is used where nf and na are estimates of the number of forward/reverse mode directional derivatives needed. By default, ad_weight is calculated automatically, but this can be overridden by setting this option. In particular, 0 means forcing forward mode and 1 forcing reverse mode. Leave unset for (class specific) heuristics."
ad_weight_sp,float,OT_DOUBLE,,,"Weighting factor for sparsity pattern calculation calculation.Override s default behavior. Set to 0 and 1 to force forward and reverse mode respectively. Cf. option 'ad_weight'. When set to -1, sparsity is completely ignored and dense matrices are used."

jac_penalty,float,OT_DOUBLE,,,"When requested for a number of forward/reverse directions, it may be cheaper to compute first the full jacobian and then multiply with seeds, rather than obtain the requested directions in a straightforward manner. Casadi uses a heuristic to decide which is cheaper. A high value of 'jac_penalty' makes it less likely for the heuristic to chose the full Jacobian strategy.
